# Example Scene: Placement

This example scene demonstrates how to place virtual content that doesn't
intersect with any real world geometry, instead it's placed on top of it.
This includes placing objects on the walls, or on top of horizontal surfaces that
are large enough to contain the object that is being placed.


## Bumper
Cycles through the placement objects: Rug, Phonograph, PictureFrame, and Chair.

## Trigger
Places an instance of the current object when there is a valid location.

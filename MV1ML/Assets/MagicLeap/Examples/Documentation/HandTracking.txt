# Example Scene: Hand Tracking
This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using hand tracking.

The UI depicts all the recognized hand key poses. As you perform these key poses
the example highlights the ones that are detected and prints both the name of the
key pose and the confidence percentage. The image mapped to the hand key pose being
performed will rotate to match the specific hand performing the key pose. When both
hands perform the same key pose, the image will spin.

In addition to this as you examine your hands, you will see various key points.

- Index Tip
- Index PIP
- Index MCP
- Middle Tip

- Middle MCP
- Ring Tip

The confidence percentage specifies how confident we are that the key pose you
are performing is the key pose that is detected.

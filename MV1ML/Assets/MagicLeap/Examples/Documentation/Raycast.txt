# Example Scene: Raycast

This example scene demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for raycasting
by displaying cursors where the rays hit. There are three raycast modes:
controller, head, and eyes.

We display cursors at the ray collision points by subscribing to the raycast
event callback.

## Bumper
Press the Bumper to cycle through the raycast modes: controller, head and eyes.

# Example Scene: Image Tracking

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using image
recognition and tracking on two-dimensional, planar images.

We recommend ambient lighting levels of at least a standard living room.

Print the DeepSea and DeepSpace images, each at a scale that fits a letter or
A4-sized sheet of paper.

For the optimal conditions for recognizing a printed image, place the images
about 1 meter away from you, at an angle no more than about 40 degrees. When
an image is recognized, the example displays a box on top of the recognized
image, and then prints "Target Found" in the UI text.

After an image is recognized, tracking can be maintained at longer distances
(about 1.5 meters) and higher angles of incidence up to around 70 degrees.

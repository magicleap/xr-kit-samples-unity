# Example Scene: Meshing

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using the
meshing functionality. The example provides a MeshingExample script that
drives parameters of the meshing API through the MLSpatiaMapper.

This example also provides an example use case of the MapEvents functionality,
clearing all fragments and refreshing the mesh when the map is lost.

The scene provides several examples of changing the way rendering and physics
interact with the meshing results. You can:
- Visualize the mesh results.
- Use the mesh results as occlusion data for virtual objects.
- Toggle the bounds extents between bounded and unbounded (max bounds) and visualize the bounds with a wire frame cube.
- Shoot prefab spheres into the scene for physics interaction.

## Bumper
Cycles rendering modes:
- Wireframe. Wireframe mesh visualization from meshed results. Virtual objects
  are occluded.
- PointCloud. Points mesh visualization from meshed results. No physics iteraction
  between shot balls and mesh.
- Occlusion. No visualization of mesh results.  Virtual objects are occluded.
- None.

## Home Button
Toggles the bounds extents:
  - Switch bounds between bounded and boundless (max bounds)
  - Bounds are represented by a clear wireframe cube where the user is at the center.

## Trigger
Shoot ball into the scene to demonstrate occlusion and physics.

## Touchpad
Swipe Up:
  - Switch level of detail of the mesh data to minimum, medium or maximum.

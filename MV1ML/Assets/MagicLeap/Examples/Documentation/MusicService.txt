# Example Scene: Music Service

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using the Music Service
API. The example needs a Background Music Service (BMS) Provider (included as a
pre-build step) and a controller to work with the User Interface.

The BMS Provider serves as the media content provider to be used by the Music Service.
To build the BMS Provider; from the top menu, click on Magic Leap, click on Setup Music
Service Example. This will build the provider in Assets/MagicLeap/BackgroundMusicExample,
copy the music_manifest.xml, and copy the sample media to Assets/StreamingAssets. See
Assets/MagicLeap/BackgroundMusicExample/readme.txt for more information.

The controller acts as a virtual pointer. A ray coming out of the controller model
indicates where the controller is pointing at. If the controller is pointing at an
interactable interface, the ray cursor is a yellow circle. Pull the trigger
to activate the interface and change the cursor color green.

## Timeline Slider
Pull the trigger while pointing at the Timeline control:
- The playhead jumps to that location. The content might need to buffer for a short
  time before playback can continue.
- You can scrub through the timeline by dragging the playhead.

## Prev/Next
Pull the trigger while pointing at the Prev/Next button:
- Jump to the previous or next track in the playlist

## Play/Pause
Pull the trigger while pointing at the Play/Pause control:
- If the media is paused, this resumes playback.
- If the media is playing, this pauses the video playback.
- If the media is stopped, this resets the playhead back to the beginning and starts playing.

## Volume Slider
Pull the trigger while pointing to the Volume control:
- Modifies the volume.

# Example Scene: Vignette

This example scene demonstrates the Vignette effect, which allows the user to cycle
between the Vignette modes: (Off, On, Mask) and adjust the power of the effect.
This helps to gradually blend the edges of the FOV to remove the hard edge once the
outer limit is reached.

Upon launching the application it will begin with the Vignette mode set to: ON, with
a power of 10 for the effect.

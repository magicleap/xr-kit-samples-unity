# Example Scene: Audio Capture

This example demonstrates the functionality of using the microphone
for audio recording and playback through the device speakers. Once
audio capture has started the parrot in the scene will repeat what
the microphone detects.

* Realtime Playback, the audio will playback immediately and without
  any pitch modifications to the audio clip.

* Delayed Playback, the audio will playback with a slightly higher
  pitch once it detects that you have finished speaking.

# Example Scene: Persistence

This example shows how you can bind dynamic content to the real world and persist them between
device reboots. The dynamic content are represented by orange spheres with blue insides. They are
created by bumper press and restored at application start up. If it fails to be created or
restored, it destroys itself and will not be restored again.

Before running the example, wait for the device to properly localize or map your surroundings. This is
confirmed by the pop-up "Landscape Recognized" or "New Landscape Created!".

The origin is represented by a box with an animated axis inside. This is where you had last regained
headpose. This could be where your device booted or where you started a new session after losing headpose.

In Debug Mode, PCFs are shown and indicated by a small red-green-blue coordinate axes with a status text
below it. These visualizers are initialized when PCFs are successfully queried from the underlying system.
On your first run, there is nothing to restore and show. Pressing the bumper would add new spheres and
bind it to the closest PCF. A status of "Good" means it loaded properly and its transform is reliable.
A status of "Lost" means that it used to be "Good" but its transform is no longer reliable. This can occur
when you lose headpose. A status of "Regained" means that it used to be "Lost" and has now found been
restored to its original world location and orientation. A status of "Updated" means the PCF's transform
has been changed (relative to the origin but still respects the position and orientation in the real world)
and is still reliable.

Notes:
(1) Although this example lets you create as many objects as you like, the cost of saving an association
between a virtual object and neighboring PCF is not small. It's recommended that you do this for a few
(anchor) objects in your scene and put most of the other objects under it.

(2) One side effect of having large quantities of dynamic content is the loading time at the beginning.

(3) PCFs are generated by the underlying system while mapping out your surroundings. PCFs cannot be
created or destroyed by the app. These coordinates frames will remain in the same location and position
in the real world and will persist between reboots.

(4) The Balls are NOT the PCFs, they're the dynamic content attached to a PCF.

## Add Content
- Press Bumper to add new content.

## Highlight Content
- Move Controller to content to highlight it.
- In debug mode, a line is drawn from the content to the PCF it is bound to.

## Remove Content
- Highlight content and tap on the touchpad to remove it.

## Remove All Content
- Perform the TouchPad Radial Scroll continuously for a while to remove all content.

## Drag Content
- Highlight content and hold trigger to drag it around.

## Debug Mode (Off by default)
- Tap home button to toggle debug mode
- Additional PCF Information will be displayed such as:
-- PCFs Loaded Count in UI
-- PCF Visualization (red-green-blue axis)
-- Line from content to PCF

## Privileges
- PcfRead
- ControllerPose

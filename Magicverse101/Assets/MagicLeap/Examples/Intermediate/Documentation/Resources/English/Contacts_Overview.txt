This example demonstrates the use of the Contacts API and can manage existing contacts on the device.
Initially, a list of available contacts is shown.
Tapping on a contact or the add new contact button, on the upper right, will load the contact for viewing/editing.
You can view/modify the name, email addresses, and phone numbers associated with that contact.

You can search through all your contacts by entering a query in the search field.

Pressing the red button beside the search query will delete a contact.

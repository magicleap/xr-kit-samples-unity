The example demonstrates  how to visualize information from the Wacom Intuos tablet using the MLInput Tablet API.

Once connected, the tablet will display which buttons are being pressed and the pen will respond by indicating position and pressure on the tablet. 

As you begin to draw the line thickness will change based on applied pressure and the color will reflect the selection from the color wheel.

With the tablet turned on, hold the center ring button until a blue light flashes on the right, to the right of the Wacom logo.

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for receiving input
from the Control controller and sending haptic feedback to it.

When the controller is connected, a controller model will appear and stats about it will
show up on the UI. This controller model will follow your physical controller with 6dof
(rotational and positional data). When the controller is disconnected, the model mapped to
this disconnected controller will disappear and the UI mapped to this controller will display
the status as disconnected.

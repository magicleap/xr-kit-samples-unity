This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using the meshing functionality.
Provided is a MeshingExample script that drives parameters of the meshing API through the MLSpatialMapper.

This example provides a use case of the MapEvents functionality, clearing all fragments and refreshing the mesh when a new map is detected.

The scene provides several examples of changing the way rendering and physics interact with the meshing results. You can:
- Visualize the mesh results.
- Use the mesh results as occlusion data for virtual objects.
- Toggle the bounds extents between bounded and unbounded (max bounds) and visualize the bounds with a wire frame cube.
- Shoot prefab spheres into the scene for physics interaction.

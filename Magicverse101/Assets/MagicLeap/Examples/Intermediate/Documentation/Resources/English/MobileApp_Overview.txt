This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for receiving input from a Magic Leap Mobile App (MLA).

When an MLA is connected, this example shows the MLA connection status in the UI.
A mobile phone model shows the state of the buttons and touch input.

This model follows your mobile device with 3 DoF rotational data after calibration is completed.
Positional data is not available for MLA. When an MLA is disconnected, the example also updates the MLA connection status in the UI.

Controllers get ignored in this example and MLA connection status in the UI will show as disconnected if only a controller is connected.

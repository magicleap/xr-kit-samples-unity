This example scene demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for detecting surfaces and displaying planes.

This example also provides an example use case of the MapEvents functionality, clearing all planes when the map is lost.

The scene detects surfaces and displays the planes in your environment as you look around. Planes can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonals, and the scene textures surfaces differently according to both untagged and semantically tagged planes (floors, walls, ceiling).

The UI text depicts the current number of planes and the maximum number of possible planes.
